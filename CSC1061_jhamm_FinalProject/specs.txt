Dinosaur Game Implementation

The proposed project involves developing a C++ version of the popular Google Chrome
Dinosaur Game. This game features a dinosaur navigating a desert landscape, avoiding
obstacles like cacti and birds by jumping over them. The C++ implementation will 
replicate the original game's mechanics while introducing additional features for
enhanced gameplay, including graphics and animation, user input and controls, 
collision detection, scoring, and increasing difficulty levels.

The C++ Implementation of the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game will offer an engaging gaming
experience by faithfully reproducing the original game's mechanics. By incorporating
features like graphics and animation, user input controls, collision detection, scoring,
and adjustable difficulty levels, the project aims to demonstrate core programming concepts
while providing players with an enjoyable gaming experience reminiscent of the popular
offline browser game.
